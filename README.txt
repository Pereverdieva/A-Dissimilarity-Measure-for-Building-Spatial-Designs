Here you can find the code for the journal paper submission "A Dissimilarity Measure for Building Spatial Designs".

In the code there are the following sections:
-Useful functions
-Generation of the sample
-Dissimilarity measure
-Use cases - here you can find the results of 2 model applications

The file "Clustering" is the resulting image of dendrogram used for the paper. 
The file "distances" is the text file containing all pair-wise dissimilarity for the whole sample. It is in the separate file not to overload the jupyter notebook.
